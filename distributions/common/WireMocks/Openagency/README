Files in this directory is used to mock requests to openagency.

Files under construction can be placed in ignored.

There are two main requests - LibraryRules on agency and LibraryRules on library group.

Files named cataloging_template_set.<library group>.xml contains a list of library rules for libraries in <library group>.

cataloging_template_set.ph.xml : contains the PH libraries - modification needed when final vip config done.

Files named agencyId.<library number>.xml contains library rules for a specific library.

Current list of agencyIds are way too big - can be reduced.

agencyId.299999.xml : Special case - used when "Agency not found" is wanted.
agencyId.010100.xml : Dataio/dbc user
agencyId.870970.xml : DBC agency code
agencyId.191919.xml : DBC enrichment agency code
agencyId.746100.xml : Special library that doesn't have the right to create notes and subject fields
